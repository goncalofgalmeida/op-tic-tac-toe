## How to Play (and rule differences)

This game is quite similar to the tic tac toe game we all know and love, with the key difference being that **each player can only have 3 tokens at the same time on the gameboard**.

1. The game starts with Player X
2. Take turns placing X or O marks on the 3Ã—3 grid
3. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. When a player makes its 4th move, the first played token will disappear from the board, and its place will be free and playable in the next turn.
5. Click the reset button to start a new game
